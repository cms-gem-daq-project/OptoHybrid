  Number of Slice LUTs:                         62 out of  92,152    1%
    Number used as logic:                       61 out of  92,152    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              34
      Number using O5 output only:              26
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    22 out of  23,038    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        28 out of  46,076    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           62
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            28 out of      62   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      62    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          34 out of      62   54%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 184,304    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 3

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
